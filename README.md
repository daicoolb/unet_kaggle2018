### Introduction

This is a solution for kaggle 2018 [data-science-bowl-2018/](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/)

I will update the network and baseline in the future days.

### Future work

- Use Mask RCNN to test
- Use PSPNet to test
- Use FCN to test
- Use RPN+FPN+FCN to test


### Observation

- This is a bianry classification problem, but also an instance segmentation problem
- Loss, metric, and ensemble methods' choices maybe improve the effect of the result
- If you want use this code, just `git clone` and `python unet.py`
  

### Dependency
- python 2.7
- keras
- tensorflow
- etc.
